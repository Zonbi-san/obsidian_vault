Some sort of Fae like creature? or maybe an Angelic being of sorts trying to seem human?
Maybe a weird unnatural skintone (pale or very light odd colored skin)
Maybe patterns as well mimicking vines
Possible animal like features (Fox ears? Moth Antennae?)
light grey eyes
Fashion style: traditional celtic, Gothic, emo (?)
Hair:
	- shoulder length curly hair or maybe style it to have her ears exposed
	- Desaturated cyan
	- semi-exposed forehead
Main outfit:
	 - tank top over fishnet top (might look noisy ngl)
	 - ripped jeans go brrrrrr
	 - maybe a flower in her hair as an accessory (something that wouldn't conflict other colors but will attract attention up to her head)
	 - platform *clap* boots *clap*
	 - shiny piercings (may also help bring attention up as well)
Lounging outfit:
	 - camisole
	 - shorts (that's it what do you want from me?)
